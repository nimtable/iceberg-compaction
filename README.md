# Compaction Runtime for Apache Iceberg™

**Disclaimer:** This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Apache Software Foundation. “Apache”, “Apache Iceberg”, and related marks are trademarks of the ASF.

`iceberg-compaction` is a high-performance Rust-based engine that compacts Apache Iceberg™ tables efficiently and safely at scale.

## 🌟 Core Highlights

- **Rust-Native Performance**: Low-latency, high-throughput compaction with memory safety guarantees
- **DataFusion Engine**: Leverages Apache DataFusion for query planning and vectorized execution
- **Iceberg Native Support**: Full compliance with Iceberg table formats via iceberg-rs
- **Multi-Cloud Ready**: Currently supports AWS S3, with plans for Azure Blob Storage and GCP Cloud Storage

## 🛠️ Basic Functionality

- **Full Compaction**: Merges all data files in an Iceberg table and removes old files
- **Deletion Support**:
  - Positional deletions (POS_DELETE)
  - Equality deletions (EQ_DELETE)

## 📝 Examples

### REST Catalog Example

We provide a complete working example using a REST catalog. This example demonstrates how to use iceberg-compaction for Iceberg table compaction with a REST catalog backend:

```bash
# Navigate to the example directory
cd examples/rest-catalog

# Run the example
cargo run
```

The example includes:
- Setting up a REST Iceberg catalog with S3 storage
- Configuring authentication and connection settings
- Performing table compaction using iceberg-compaction

For more details, see the [rest-catalog example](./examples/rest-catalog/).

# Development Roadmap

## Performance 🚀
- [] Partial compaction: Support incremental compaction strategies
- [] Compaction Policy: Multiple built-in policies (size-based, time-based, cost-optimized)
- [] Built-in cache: Metadata and query result caching for improved performance

## Stability 🔒
- [] Spill to disk: Handle large datasets that exceed memory limits
- [] Network rebuild: Robust handling of network failures and retries
- [] Task breakpoint resume: Resume operations from failure points
- [] E2E test framework: Comprehensive testing infrastructure

## Observability 📊
- [] Job progress display: Progress tracking
- [] Comprehensive compaction metrics: Detailed performance and operation metrics

## Customizability 🎛️
- [] Tune parquet: Configurable Parquet writer parameters
- [] Fine-grained configurable compaction parameters: Extensive customization options
