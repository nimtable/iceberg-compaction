## 🌟 Core Highlights

- **Rust-Native Performance**: Low-latency, high-throughput compaction with memory safety guarantees
- **DataFusion Engine**: Leverages Apache DataFusion for query planning and vectorized execution
- **Iceberg Native Support**: Full compliance with Iceberg table formats via iceberg-rs
- **Multi-Cloud Ready**: Currently supports AWS S3, with plans for Azure Blob Storage and GCP Cloud Storage

## 🛠️ Basic Functionality

- **Full Compaction**: Merges all data files in an Iceberg table and removes old files
- **Deletion Support**:
  - Positional deletions (POS_DELETE)
  - Equality deletions (EQ_DELETE)
