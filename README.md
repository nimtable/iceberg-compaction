# Compaction Runtime for Apache Iceberg‚Ñ¢

**Disclaimer:** This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Apache Software Foundation. ‚ÄúApache‚Äù, ‚ÄúApache Iceberg‚Äù, and related marks are trademarks of the ASF.

`iceberg-compaction` is a high-performance Rust-based engine that compacts Apache Iceberg‚Ñ¢ tables efficiently and safely at scale.

## üåü Core Highlights

- **Rust-Native Performance**: Low-latency, high-throughput compaction with memory safety guarantees
- **DataFusion Engine**: Leverages Apache DataFusion for query planning and vectorized execution
- **Iceberg Native Support**: Full compliance with Iceberg table formats via iceberg-rs
- **Multi-Cloud Ready**: Currently supports AWS S3, with plans for Azure Blob Storage and GCP Cloud Storage

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Functionality

- **Full Compaction**: Merges all data files in an Iceberg table and removes old files
- **Deletion Support**:
  - Positional deletions (POS_DELETE)
  - Equality deletions (EQ_DELETE)

## üìù Examples

### Memory Catalog Example

We provide a complete working example using an in-memory catalog. This example demonstrates how to use iceberg-compaction for Iceberg table compaction:

```bash
# Navigate to the example directory
cd examples/memory-catalog

# Run the example
cargo run
```

The example includes:
- Setting up an in-memory Iceberg catalog
- Creating a sample table.
- Performing table compaction using iceberg-compaction

For more details, see the [memory-catalog example](./examples/memory-catalog/).
